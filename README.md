# Fraud Detection in E-Commerce and Bank Transactions

## Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-based fraud detection system for e-commerce and bank credit transactions. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate fraud detection model using transaction data, geolocation analysis, and advanced feature engineering techniques.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning model development, and evaluation for the detection of fraudulent activities in financial transactions.

## Project Structure:
- **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:**
  - `data_cleaning.py`: Data cleaning and missing value imputation.
  - `feature_engineering.py`: Feature extraction including transaction velocity, frequency, and time-based features.
  - `geolocation_analysis.py`: Integration of IP address geolocation data.

- **Model Development:**
  - `model_training.py`: Script for training machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
  - `model_evaluation.py`: Evaluation of model performance using precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Deployment & Monitoring:**
  - `real_time_detection.py`: Implementation of fraud detection in real-time transaction systems.
  - `model_monitoring.py`: Set up for continuous model evaluation and improvement.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation:
To install the required dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run:
1. Prepare the datasets (`Fraud_Data.csv`, `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`, `creditcard.csv`) in the `data` directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```
   python data_cleaning.py
   python feature_engineering.py
   python geolocation_analysis.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```
   python model_training.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```
   python model_evaluation.py
   ```
5. For real-time detection, execute:
   ```
   python real_time_detection.py
   ```
