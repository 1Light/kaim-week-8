# **Fraud Detection in E-Commerce and Bank Transactions: Project Report**

## **1. Project Understanding**

### **Project Overview:**
At Adey Innovations Inc., a leading company in the financial technology sector, the focus is on enhancing the detection of fraudulent activities within e-commerce and bank credit transactions. Fraudulent transactions pose a significant threat to the financial sector, resulting in loss of trust, financial damage, and additional regulatory scrutiny. This project aims to develop robust fraud detection models by leveraging machine learning, feature engineering, and geolocation analysis to identify suspicious patterns across e-commerce and banking transaction data.

The core objective is to implement accurate fraud detection systems for real-time monitoring, leveraging historical transaction data and advanced analytical techniques to pinpoint anomalous behavior before it leads to significant financial loss. The project also focuses on improving transaction security and building trust between businesses and customers, while improving efficiency through automated monitoring.

### **Key Objectives:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing data, clean and transform raw datasets, ensuring the quality and accuracy of the input data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features like transaction frequency, velocity, time-based features, and integrate geolocation insights based on IP addresses.
- **Model Development:** Build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for fraud detection.
- **Geolocation Analysis:** Integrate external geolocation data to identify patterns in transaction locations, potentially identifying unusual or fraudulent activities based on user location.
- **Model Deployment:** Implement real-time fraud detection systems, ensuring scalability and efficiency in detecting fraudulent transactions.
  
### **Expected Impact:**
- **Enhanced Security:** Reduces the risk of financial losses by enabling proactive fraud detection.
- **Increased Trust:** Improves customer confidence in e-commerce and banking transactions.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous fraud monitoring allows for immediate response, mitigating potential risks before they escalate.
- **Scalability:** Deployment of fraud detection systems that can handle increasing transaction volumes effectively.

## **2. Project Progression**

### **Task 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing**

#### **Objective:**
The first phase of the project involved comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing. This phase was critical for transforming raw data into a format that can be effectively utilized by machine learning models for fraud detection.

#### **Methodology:**

**Data Sources:**
- **Fraud_Data.csv**: E-commerce transaction data aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions, containing user and transaction-specific features.
- **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**: Mapped IP address ranges to countries, essential for performing geolocation analysis.
- **creditcard.csv**: Bank transaction data containing anonymized features and transaction amounts for fraud detection.

**Steps Implemented:**

1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - The dataset contained minimal missing values, which were primarily associated with a few transactional features in the **Fraud_Data.csv** dataset. These were imputed using the median value for numerical features and the mode for categorical features, as this provided a reasonable estimate without skewing the data.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Duplicates in the **Fraud_Data.csv** were removed. Duplications were relatively minor (under 1%), but addressing them was essential to ensure the integrity of our analysis.
   - Data types were corrected for fields like `purchase_time` and `signup_time` to ensure they were in appropriate datetime formats for time-based analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Univariate Analysis:** Distribution of transaction values showed a skew towards lower values, which is typical in real-world transaction data. The class imbalance (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent) was evident, with fraudulent transactions representing only 2.5% of the total.
   - **Bivariate Analysis:** A strong correlation was observed between the `purchase_value` and the likelihood of fraud, with higher transaction values having a slightly elevated likelihood of being flagged as fraudulent. Additionally, transaction times during off-hours (late nights, weekends) exhibited higher fraud rates.

4. **Geolocation Integration:**
   - The IP addresses in the **Fraud_Data.csv** were converted into integer format for easier mapping with the **IpAddress_to_Country.csv** dataset. Using geolocation data, we observed that a significant percentage of fraud cases originated from foreign IP addresses or inconsistent location patterns.
   - A merge of the e-commerce transaction dataset with the geolocation data revealed that over 10% of fraudulent transactions originated from IP addresses outside the country where the transaction was initiated, highlighting a potential red flag in cross-border fraud cases.

5. **Feature Engineering:**
   - **Transaction Frequency and Velocity:** For each user, we calculated transaction frequency (number of transactions per day) and transaction velocity (amount spent per transaction over a short period). These features proved to be highly discriminative in detecting abnormal behavior typical of fraudulent users.
   - **Time-Based Features:** 
     - **Hour of the Day**: Transactions occurring late at night showed a higher probability of being fraudulent.
     - **Day of the Week**: Fraudulent transactions were more likely to occur during weekends, as observed in several time-based breakdowns.

6. **Normalization and Scaling:**
   - Numerical features such as `purchase_value` and transaction frequencies were normalized using Min-Max scaling to ensure all features were on a comparable scale, which is essential for model convergence and performance.

7. **Encoding Categorical Features:**
   - Categorical features, including `source`, `browser`, and `sex`, were encoded using One-Hot Encoding to provide machine learning models with usable numerical representations of these attributes.

#### **Findings and Insights:**

- **Class Imbalance:** The dataset exhibited a strong class imbalance, with only 2.5% of the transactions being fraudulent. This imbalance required careful handling during model development (e.g., using oversampling techniques like SMOTE).
- **Transaction Patterns:** Certain patterns in transaction behavior, such as unusually high purchase values or rapid purchasing from multiple locations, were significant indicators of fraud.
- **Geolocation Insights:** A substantial portion of fraudulent transactions came from foreign countries or mismatched IP geolocation data, which became a key feature in our model for detecting fraud.

#### **Challenges Encountered:**
- **Data Imbalance:** The class imbalance in the fraud detection task required advanced handling, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which was applied during model training.
- **Geolocation Accuracy:** The accuracy of IP-to-country mapping was somewhat limited by the available IP ranges in the geolocation database, and there were occasional mismatches, especially for VPN or proxy IPs.

#### **Task 1 Conclusion:**
The data analysis and preprocessing tasks were successfully completed, with comprehensive cleaning, feature engineering, and geolocation analysis. The dataset was adequately prepared for the next stage of model development, and insights gained during this phase, such as transaction velocity and time-based features, will play a crucial role in detecting fraud.

## **Next Steps:**
- **Model Development:** The next phase will involve training machine learning models using the prepared data. Various models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, will be explored to determine which provides the best performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score for detecting fraudulent transactions.
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning:** Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to ensure that the models generalize well to unseen data.
- **Real-Time Deployment:** Following model development, the best-performing models will be deployed in a real-time fraud detection system.
